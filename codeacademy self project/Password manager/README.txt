Hi all, this project is a password manager script which allows you to store your account username and password while making the password you stored encrypted. 
This requires the 3 files together to work. Script.py being the main file, master_pass_encrypted.py as the file which stores your encrypted master password and the passwords.txt file which stores all your added accounts and passowrds.
This project uses cryptography Fernet for the encryption.

Cheers,
